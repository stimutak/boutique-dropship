# NEXT_STEPS.md - Project Completion Roadmap

**IMPORTANT: Read CLAUDE.md first for critical project constraints**

## üìä Current Project Status: ~90% Complete (29/32 tasks done)

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed:
- **Error Handling Standardization** (July 31, 2025) ‚úÖ FULLY COMPLETE
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling with i18n support for 8 languages
  - Fixed all test failures - auth tests now 32/32 passing
  - Cleaned up massive test file mess (removed 11 root-level test files)
  - Standardized error responses across all routes
  - Fixed address management validation in auth routes
  - All error codes properly translated via i18n

### üéØ Remaining Tasks (3 of 32)

## 1. Order Fulfillment Workflow üöö
**Agent**: Use `sprint-architect-planner` agent  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Description**: Implement admin functionality to process and ship orders

### Requirements:
- Admin can view all orders with filtering/sorting
- Order status workflow: pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí shipped ‚Üí delivered
- Bulk order operations
- Shipping label generation integration
- Order tracking updates
- Email notifications for status changes

### Technical Approach:
- Add order status endpoints in `/routes/orders.js`
- Create admin-only order management endpoints
- Implement order state machine logic
- Add shipping provider integration hooks

### Files to modify:
- `/routes/orders.js` - Add admin endpoints
- `/routes/admin.js` - Add order management routes
- `/models/Order.js` - May need status tracking fields
- `/utils/emailService.js` - Status change notifications

---

## 2. Email Notifications üìß
**Agent**: Use `general-purpose` agent  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Description**: Implement automated email notifications for key events

### Requirements:
- Order confirmation emails
- Shipping notification emails
- Password reset emails (already partially implemented)
- Welcome emails (already partially implemented)
- Admin notification for large orders

### Technical Approach:
- Email service already exists in `/utils/emailService.js`
- Need to integrate with order lifecycle events
- Add email templates with i18n support
- Implement retry logic for failed emails

### Files to modify:
- `/utils/emailService.js` - Add new email types
- `/routes/orders.js` - Trigger emails on order events
- `/routes/payments.js` - Send confirmation after payment
- Create email templates with multi-language support

---

## 3. Admin Dashboard üìä
**Agent**: Use `system-architect-tdd` agent  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Description**: Build comprehensive admin interface for store management

### Requirements:
- Dashboard with key metrics (sales, orders, users)
- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Order management interface
- User management
- Sales analytics and reports
- Inventory tracking

### Technical Approach:
- Most backend APIs already exist
- Need to add analytics endpoints
- Create aggregation queries for metrics
- Add admin-specific data endpoints

### Files to modify:
- `/routes/admin.js` - Add dashboard data endpoints
- Create analytics utilities for data aggregation
- Add authorization checks for admin routes
- Implement caching for expensive queries

## üìã Implementation Order

1. **Start with Order Fulfillment** (sprint-architect-planner)
   - Most critical for business operations
   - Builds on existing order system
   - Enables revenue generation

2. **Then Email Notifications** (general-purpose)
   - Enhances user experience
   - Relatively straightforward implementation
   - Leverages existing email service

3. **Finally Admin Dashboard** (system-architect-tdd)
   - Ties everything together
   - Can be iteratively improved
   - Less critical for launch

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

1. **ALWAYS read CLAUDE.md first** - Contains critical constraints
2. **Don't create duplicate files** - Check existing code first
3. **Follow existing patterns** - This is a standard e-commerce app
4. **Fix in place** - Modify existing files rather than creating new ones
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure all tests pass before marking complete

## üöÄ Starting a Task

When starting a new session, tell Claude:
```
"I need to implement the [Order Fulfillment Workflow/Email Notifications/Admin Dashboard]. 
Please use the [sprint-architect-planner/general-purpose/system-architect-tdd] agent 
following the requirements in NEXT_STEPS.md and constraints in CLAUDE.md"
```

## üìà Success Metrics

Each task is complete when:
- All requirements are implemented
- Tests are written and passing
- Code follows CLAUDE.md guidelines
- No duplicate code is created
- Feature works end-to-end
