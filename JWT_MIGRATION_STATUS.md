# JWT Migration Status

## Overview
Migrating JWT storage from localStorage to httpOnly cookies for enhanced security while maintaining backward compatibility during transition.

## ✅ Completed Backend Changes

### 1. Server Configuration
- ✅ Added `cookie-parser` middleware to server.js
- ✅ Configured with proper security settings

### 2. Auth Routes (`/routes/auth.js`)
- ✅ Updated `/login` endpoint to set httpOnly cookie with token
- ✅ Updated `/register` endpoint to set httpOnly cookie with token  
- ✅ Added `/verify` endpoint for cookie-based auth verification
- ✅ Updated `/logout` to clear JWT cookie
- ✅ Still sending token in response for backward compatibility

### 3. Auth Middleware (`/middleware/auth.js`)
- ✅ Updated to check cookies before Authorization header
- ✅ Falls back to Bearer token for backward compatibility
- ✅ Works with both cookie and header-based auth

### 4. Cookie Configuration
```javascript
res.cookie('token', token, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'strict',
  maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 7 days
  path: '/'
});
```

## 🔧 Frontend Changes In Progress

### 1. API Configuration (`/client/src/api/config.js`)
- ✅ Already has `withCredentials: true` for cookie support
- ✅ Still checks localStorage for backward compatibility

### 2. Auth Slice (`/client/src/store/slices/authSlice.js`)
- ✅ Added `verifyAuth` thunk that uses cookie-based `/verify` endpoint
- ✅ Updated `loadUser` to try cookie auth first, then fall back to token
- ✅ Still storing token in localStorage for backward compatibility
- ✅ Added verifyAuth reducers to handle cookie-based auth state

### 3. App.jsx
- 🔧 Still using token-based auth check on startup
- 📝 TODO: Update to use verifyAuth for cookie-based auth

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Backend Testing
- ✅ Login endpoint working correctly (tested via curl)
- ✅ Cookie being set properly with httpOnly, Secure, SameSite flags
- ✅ Verify endpoint working with cookie auth
- ✅ Products API working correctly

### Frontend Issues
- ⚠️ Login appears to fail in UI despite backend success
- 📝 Need to investigate frontend auth flow handling

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Update App.jsx** to use verifyAuth instead of checking localStorage token
2. **Test frontend login flow** to ensure proper cookie handling
3. **Update logout** to call backend logout endpoint
4. **Remove localStorage usage** after confirming cookie auth works
5. **Update all protected routes** to use cookie-based auth

## 🔐 Security Improvements

- Tokens no longer accessible via JavaScript (XSS protection)
- Secure flag ensures HTTPS-only in production
- SameSite=strict prevents CSRF attacks
- HttpOnly prevents client-side access

## 🚨 Breaking Changes
None - maintaining backward compatibility during migration phase.
