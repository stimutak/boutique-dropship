# CLAUDE.md

⚠️ **MANDATORY: This file contains CRITICAL project constraints that MUST be followed.**

This file provides critical guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository. **YOU MUST READ THIS ENTIRE FILE BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES.**

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL RESULT IN REJECTED CODE.**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: STOP AND THINK BEFORE CODING

### Before You Write ANY Code:
1. **CHECK IF IT ALREADY EXISTS** - This codebase has significant duplication. Search thoroughly.
2. **DON'T CREATE "ENHANCED" VERSIONS** - We already have unused enhancedAuthSlice.js and enhancedCartSlice.js
3. **DON'T ADD UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY** - No event emitters, connection pools, or performance monitoring unless explicitly requested
4. **USE EXISTING PATTERNS** - Follow the patterns already established in the codebase

## 🌍 INTERNATIONALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

### This is an INTERNATIONAL e-commerce platform that MUST support:
- **Multiple Languages**: 10+ languages including RTL (Arabic, Hebrew)
- **Multiple Currencies**: 20+ currencies with real-time conversion
- **Global Payment Methods**: Mollie handles international payments
- **Localization**: Date/time formats, number formats, address formats per region

### When implementing ANY feature:
1. **Always consider multi-language support** - Use i18n keys, not hardcoded strings
2. **Always handle multiple currencies** - Store amounts with currency codes
3. **Always use locale-aware formatting** - Dates, numbers, addresses
4. **Test with RTL languages** - UI must work in both LTR and RTL

## 🚨 Known Issues and What NOT to Do

### 1. **Duplicate Code - ✅ CLEANED UP**
- **Enhanced Redux Slices**: ✅ REMOVED - No enhanced versions exist anymore
- **Old Route Files**: ✅ CLEANED - No -old or -fixed files remain
- **Duplicate Test Files**: ✅ FIXED - Only original test files exist
- **Multiple Scripts**: Still have many scripts in `/scripts/` - use existing ones before creating new

### 2. **Architecture Rules - FOLLOW THESE**
- **NO NEW ABSTRACTION LAYERS**: Don't create service layers that wrap existing functionality
- **NO EVENT EMITTERS**: The cartService.js already has unnecessary EventEmitter complexity
- **USE EXISTING MIDDLEWARE**: Don't create new auth middleware - `authenticateToken`, `requireAuth`, and `requireAdmin` already exist
- **KEEP IT SIMPLE**: This is a standard e-commerce app, not a distributed system

### Route Ordering - CRITICAL:
- ⚠️ **ROUTE ORDER MATTERS**: In admin.js, specific routes MUST come before parameterized routes
- Example: `/users/stats` must be defined BEFORE `/users/:id`
- This prevents "stats" from being interpreted as a MongoDB ObjectId

### 3. **Security Issues - ✅ MOSTLY FIXED**
- **JWT Storage**: ✅ FIXED - Now using httpOnly cookies
- **localStorage references**: ✅ REDUCED - JWT removed from localStorage, only UI preferences remain
- **CSRF Protection**: ✅ WORKING - Implemented in `sessionCSRF.js`
- **Cart Persistence**: ✅ FIXED - Uses atomic operations with proper cleanup

### 4. **Performance Problems - ✅ MOSTLY FIXED**
- **N+1 Queries**: ✅ FIXED - Order routes now use batch queries
- **Missing Indexes**: ✅ ADDED - Database indexes on email, customer+date, price+active
- **Code Splitting**: ⚠️ TODO - Frontend still loads everything at once
- **CSS Performance**: ✅ OPTIMIZED - Admin dashboard uses CSS custom properties for theming

## 📁 Project Structure - WHERE THINGS BELONG

### Backend Structure:
```
├── server.js              # Main server (PORT from .env, not hardcoded)
├── models/                # Mongoose models ONLY
├── routes/                # Express routes - thin controllers only
├── middleware/            # Reusable middleware
├── utils/                 # Pure utility functions
└── scripts/               # One-off scripts (CHECK BEFORE CREATING NEW ONES)
```

### Frontend Structure:
```
client/
├── src/
│   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/          # Route-level components
│   ├── store/          # Redux store (USE EXISTING SLICES)
│   └── api/            # API configuration
```

### What NOT to Create:
- ❌ `/services/` directory - routes handle business logic
- ❌ Enhanced versions of existing files
- ❌ New test files with "-fixed" or "-new" suffixes
- ❌ Debug components in production directories

### CSS Architecture:
- **Admin Dashboard**: Uses CSS custom properties for theming
- **Variables**: Defined in :root for consistent spacing, colors, typography
- **Mobile-First**: All admin CSS includes responsive breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Focus states, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

## 🔧 Development Commands

## ✅ Best Practices for This Codebase

### When Asked to Fix Something:
1. **Search First**: Use Grep/Glob to find existing implementations
2. **Read the File**: Understand current implementation before changing
3. **Update in Place**: Modify existing files rather than creating new ones
4. **Test Existing Tests**: Run tests before and after changes
5. **Check for Side Effects**: This codebase has many interdependencies

### When Asked to Add Features:
1. **Check Scripts Directory**: Feature might already exist as a script
2. **Use Existing Patterns**: Follow patterns in similar routes/components
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Don't add new packages unless absolutely necessary
4. **Simple Solutions**: Avoid over-engineering (no event emitters, observables, etc.)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Creating "enhanced" or "improved" versions of existing code
- Adding abstraction layers that don't add value
- Implementing complex patterns for simple problems
- Creating duplicate test files instead of fixing existing ones
- Adding performance monitoring for operations that take milliseconds

## 🚀 Optimization Opportunities (If Asked)

### High Priority:
1. ✅ DONE - Fix N+1 queries in order creation (batch product lookups)
2. ✅ DONE - Add database indexes (User: email, Order: customer+createdAt, Product: price+isActive)
3. ⏳ TODO - Implement code splitting (lazy load routes)
4. ⏳ TODO - Fix memory leaks (event listeners not cleaned up)

### Medium Priority:
1. ⏳ TODO - Consolidate duplicate auth middleware functions
2. ⏳ NEXT - Create centralized error handling
3. ✅ DONE - Move JWT to httpOnly cookies
4. ⏳ TODO - Add response caching

### Low Priority:
1. ⏳ TODO - Remove unused dependencies
2. ✅ DONE - Consolidate test files
3. ⏳ TODO - Clean up scripts directory
4. ✅ DONE - Remove dead code (enhanced slices)

## 📝 Environment Configuration

Required `.env` variables:
```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5001                    # Backend port
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/holistic-store
JWT_SECRET=[32+ characters]  # Must be at least 32 chars
SESSION_SECRET=[long string]
MOLLIE_API_KEY=[your key]
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## 🎯 Summary: Think Before You Code

1. **This codebase already has too much code** - Don't add more without good reason
2. **Duplication is the enemy** - Always search for existing implementations
3. **Simple is better** - This is an e-commerce site, not a spaceship
4. **Fix in place** - Update existing code rather than creating new versions
5. **Test thoroughly** - Many interdependencies exist

Remember: The best code is often the code you don't write. Always consider if the existing code can be fixed or reused before creating something new.

## 🔒 How to Ensure AI Agents Follow This Guide

1. **Always reference CLAUDE.md** in your prompts:
   ```
   "Following the constraints in CLAUDE.md, implement..."
   "As specified in CLAUDE.md, avoid creating enhanced versions..."
   ```

2. **Explicitly state constraints**:
   ```
   "DO NOT create new files, modify existing ones"
   "This is an international platform - include i18n support"
   "Keep it simple - no event emitters or complex patterns"
   ```

3. **Review AI output against this checklist**:
   - [ ] No new "enhanced" versions created?
   - [ ] No duplicate files with -fixed, -new suffixes?
   - [ ] Uses existing middleware and patterns?
   - [ ] Includes i18n considerations?
   - [ ] Follows security best practices?

4. **Reject non-compliant code**:
   - If AI creates duplicate files, reject and re-prompt
   - If AI adds unnecessary complexity, reject and request simpler solution
   - If AI ignores i18n requirements, reject and request international support
