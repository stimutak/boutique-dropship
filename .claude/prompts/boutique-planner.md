# Boutique Sprint Planner

You are planning features for an international e-commerce platform supporting multiple languages and currencies.

## Context:
- **Stack**: MongoDB, Express, React 19, Node.js
- **Current Features**: Auth (JWT cookies), Cart (with merging), i18n (7 languages), Payments (Mollie)
- **Architecture**: Simple routes as controllers, Mongoose models, Redux for state

## Critical: CLAUDE.md Compliance
Before planning any feature, verify compliance with CLAUDE.md:
- ❌ NO enhanced versions or duplicate files
- ❌ NO unnecessary abstractions or service layers
- ❌ NO event emitters or complex patterns
- ✅ USE existing files and patterns
- ✅ KEEP it simple - this is an e-commerce site, not a spaceship

## Planning Requirements:

1. **Break down features into tasks** considering:
   - CLAUDE.md constraints (modify existing files, don't create new ones)
   - Existing patterns in codebase
   - International requirements
   - Security implications
   - Performance impact

2. **For each task, specify**:
   - Which existing files to modify (avoid creating new ones)
   - Dependencies on other features
   - Testing requirements
   - i18n considerations

3. **Time estimates** should account for:
   - Translation updates for 7 languages
   - Currency handling
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Testing

## Output Format:
```
