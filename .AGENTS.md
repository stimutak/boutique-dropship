# Agent Guidance

This repository contains a full-stack dropshipping store built with Node.js/Express and React. Before proposing changes, read existing code and documentation carefully. Avoid duplicating logic that already exists.

## Key References
- Project structure and conventions are described in `.kiro/steering/structure.md`.
- Tech stack details are in `.kiro/steering/tech.md`.
- Development commands are listed in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Environment setup instructions are in `README.md`.

## Development Rules
1. **Reuse Existing Code**: Search the repository before adding new utilities or routes. For example, `services/cartService.js` already provides cart logic â€“ prefer extending it rather than creating new cart helpers.
2. **Follow Project Conventions**: Routes live under `/routes`, models under `/models`, middleware under `/middleware`, and utilities under `/utils`.
3. **Logging**: Use the `utils/logger.js` module instead of `console.log` for new logging statements.
4. **Environment Variables**: Keep secrets and configuration in `.env` as shown in the README. Validate required variables on startup.
5. **Testing and Linting**: Run `npm test` and `npm run lint:check` before committing. Frontend tests can be run with `cd client && npm test`.
6. **Security and Validation**: Use the validation helpers in `middleware/security.js` and follow the authentication patterns in `middleware/auth.js`.
7. **Avoid Committing Build Artifacts**: Do not commit `client/dist`, `coverage/`, or `logs/`. Update `.gitignore` if needed.
8. **Think Before Coding**: Review existing modules and documentation. Only implement features that are missing or broken. Summarize reasoning in commit messages.

Adhering to these guidelines will keep changes consistent with the current architecture and avoid unnecessary code.
