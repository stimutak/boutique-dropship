# Blog Feature Implementation (Complete)

This document summarizes the blog feature added to the project, covering backend, frontend, routing, styling, i18n, and how to provide images/screenshots. It follows CLAUDE.md rules: fix-in-place, thin routes, i18n-aware, no new service layers, and security-first.

## Goals
- ✅ Public blog with full-screen background image and two separate card display fields
- ✅ Clean "From The Blog" title header
- ✅ Admin-friendly CRUD for posts with rich editing features
- ✅ Internationalization-ready content model with locale fallbacks
- ✅ Responsive design that works on all devices

## Backend

- Model: `models/BlogPost.js`
  - Fields: `slug` (unique), `title`, `excerpt`, `content`, `translations` (Map of `{ title, excerpt, content }`), `coverImage { url, alt }`, `tags`, `author`, `published`, `publishedAt`, `readingTime`.
  - Indexes: `{ published: 1, publishedAt: -1 }` and text index on title/excerpt/content/tags.
  - Helper: `getLocalized(locale)` returns content with fallback to base fields.

- Public Routes: `routes/blog.js`
  - `GET /api/blog?page=&limit=`
    - Returns `{ posts, pagination }`. Defaults: `limit=2` for the 2-per-page book view.
    - Localized via `x-locale` header (falls back to `en`).
  - `GET /api/blog/:slug`
    - Returns a single published post (localized as above).

- Admin Routes: in `routes/admin.js` (CSRF + admin + rate limiting already applied globally in this file)
  - `POST /api/admin/blog` — Create post (requires `slug`, `title`, `content`). Sets `readingTime` from word count; sets `publishedAt` if `published` is true.
  - `PUT /api/admin/blog/:id` — Update post. Recomputes `readingTime` if `content` changes; auto-sets `publishedAt` when publishing.
  - `DELETE /api/admin/blog/:id` — Delete post.
  - `GET /api/admin/blog?page=&limit=` — List all posts for admin.
  - `POST /api/admin/blog/images` — Upload cover images. Stored under `public/images/blog/`; standard image validation limits via existing upload security.

- Server Wiring: `server.js`
  - `app.use('/api/blog', require('./routes/blog'))` registered with other routes.

## Frontend

- Store Slices
  - Public: `client/src/store/slices/blogSlice.js`
    - `fetchBlogPosts({ page, limit })` and `fetchBlogPostBySlug(slug)` with loading/error/pagination state.
  - Admin: `client/src/store/slices/adminBlogSlice.js`
    - `fetchAdminBlogPosts`, `createBlogPost`, `updateBlogPost`, `deleteBlogPost`, `uploadBlogImages`.
  - Store wiring: `client/src/store/store.js` adds reducers `blog` and `adminBlog`.

- Pages (Public)
  - `client/src/pages/Blog.jsx` — Blog list with 2 posts displayed as separate white cards over full-screen background; paginated via `?page=`.
  - `client/src/pages/BlogPost.jsx` — Single post view; uses HTML content rendering.

- Pages (Admin) - **Enhanced with Professional UI**
  - `client/src/pages/admin/AdminBlog.jsx` — Professional admin table with status badges, inline actions, empty state, and pagination.
  - `client/src/pages/admin/AdminBlogNew.jsx` — Rich create form with tag management, live preview, author field, and organized card sections.
  - `client/src/pages/admin/AdminBlogEdit.jsx` — Full-featured edit form with publish toggle and cover upload support.

- Routing: `client/src/App.jsx`
  - Public: `/blog`, `/blog/:slug` (lazy-loaded with existing Suspense/ErrorBoundary).
  - Admin: `/admin/blog`, `/admin/blog/new`, `/admin/blog/:id/edit` (protected by existing `AdminRoute`).

- Navigation
  - Header link: Added “Blog” to `client/src/components/Layout/Header.jsx` (main + mobile menus).
  - Admin nav: Added “Blog Management” to `client/src/components/Layout/AdminLayout.jsx`.

## Styling (Modern Card Design)

- Global CSS: `client/src/index.css`
  - **New Design System**:
    - `.blog-background`: Full-screen fixed background with image or gradient fallback
    - `.blog-main-title`: Large white "From The Blog" header with text shadow
    - `.blog-posts-grid`: CSS Grid layout for two separate cards
    - `.blog-card`: White rounded cards with hover effects and shadows
    - `.blog-card-*`: Component classes for date, title, image, excerpt, and footer
    - `.blog-navigation`: Clean pagination with hover effects
  - **Responsive Design**: Cards stack vertically on mobile (< 900px)
  - **Interactive Effects**: Card lift on hover, image zoom, smooth transitions

- Providing Your Background Image
  - Place your image at `public/images/blog/hero.jpg`
  - Fallback: Beautiful gradient (purple to blue) if no image provided
  - Image requirements: High resolution, landscape orientation recommended

- Post Cover Images
  - In Admin (New/Edit), upload via “Upload Cover Image”, then click “Use first uploaded as cover”; or paste any hosted URL in the “Cover Image URL” field.

## Internationalization
- Data Model: `BlogPost.translations` (Map) mirrors product translation approach; API selects localized fields using `x-locale` request header (falls back to base fields).
- UI Strings: Complete English translations in `client/src/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`:
  - Public: `navigation.blog`, `blog.title`, `blog.readMore`
  - Admin: `admin.blog.title`, `admin.blog.add`, `admin.blog.edit`, `admin.blog.confirmDelete`, etc.
- RTL: Layout inherits existing RTL handling from the app; content flows correctly in both directions.

## Security
- Admin routes are protected by existing `requireAdmin`, CSRF middleware, and rate limiting defined in `routes/admin.js`.
- Image uploads use existing multer limits and file type validation; blog images saved under `public/images/blog/`.
- Public routes expose published content only; drafts are hidden.

## Performance Notes
- Pagination defaults to 2 per page to support the “book-like” visual.
- Static images are served from `public/` via Express static middleware.
- API client uses relative base URL and existing interceptors (locale, CSRF, cookie-based auth where applicable).

## Admin Features Added
- **Enhanced Blog Management Table**:
  - Status badges (Published/Draft)
  - Quick view, edit, delete actions with icons
  - Empty state when no posts exist
  - Pagination for large post counts
  - Shows author, publication date, excerpt preview

- **Rich Post Creation/Editing**:
  - Auto-slug generation from title
  - Tag management system (add/remove tags)
  - Author field
  - Live image preview
  - Organized form sections with cards
  - Cancel button for navigation
  - Loading states with spinners

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Rich text/Markdown editor in Admin
- Per-locale editing UI for translations
- SEO fields (meta title/description) and Open Graph tags
- Scheduling: `publishAt` for delayed publishing
- Comment system
- Related posts suggestions
- Social media sharing buttons

- **Two separate white cards** for blog posts (not connected like a book)
- **Full-screen background image** with semi-transparent overlay
- **Professional card design** with hover effects

- **Fully responsive** - cards stack on mobile devices

To customize the background, place your image at `public/images/blog/hero.jpg`.
