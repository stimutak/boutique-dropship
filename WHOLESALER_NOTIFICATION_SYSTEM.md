# Wholesaler Notification System

## Overview

A comprehensive automated system that processes orders with 'paid' or 'processing' status and sends professional email notifications to wholesalers for order fulfillment. The system handles dropshipping workflow by automatically communicating order details to suppliers without requiring inventory management.

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Core Components Created

1. **Email Service** (`utils/emailService.js`)
   - Nodemailer integration with environment configuration
   - Professional email template generation
   - Error handling and success reporting

2. **Notification Service** (`utils/wholesalerNotificationService.js`)
   - Automated order processing logic
   - Wholesaler grouping and notification batching
   - Database updates for notification tracking
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

3. **API Routes** (`routes/wholesalers.js`)
   - `POST /api/wholesalers/process-notifications` - Process all pending
   - `POST /api/wholesalers/notify/:orderId` - Process specific order
   - `GET /api/wholesalers/pending` - List orders needing notification
   - `GET /api/wholesalers/status/:orderId` - Check notification status
   - `GET /api/wholesalers/test` - System health check

4. **Processing Scripts**
   - `scripts/processWholesalerNotifications.js` - Standalone processing
   - `scripts/testWholesalerNotifications.js` - Full system test with sample data
   - `scripts/demoWholesalerNotifications.js` - Demonstration without DB

## System Workflow

### 1. Order Detection
- Scans for orders with `payment.status: 'paid'` OR `status: 'processing'`
- Identifies items where `wholesaler.notified: false`
- Groups items by wholesaler email for batch processing

### 2. Email Generation
- Creates professional emails with:
  - Order number and date
  - Complete customer shipping address
  - Product codes and quantities
  - Special handling notes
  - Professional business formatting

### 3. Notification Processing
- Sends emails to each unique wholesaler
- Updates order items: `wholesaler.notified = true`
- Records timestamp: `wholesaler.notifiedAt = Date`
- Logs success/failure for monitoring

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of email failures
- Detailed error reporting
- Retry capabilities for failed notifications
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
