# User Profile Management Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues with user profile management, authentication persistence, and cart preservation in the holistic dropshipping store. The current system has several problems that create poor user experience and functional failures.

## Current Issues Identified

1. **Profile Information Not Saving** - User profile updates are not persisting properly
2. **Forced Re-login Loop** - Profile updates cause authentication to be lost, creating endless login loops
3. **Cart Loss on Login** - Guest cart items disappear when users log in (session vs localStorage mismatch)
4. **Authentication State Management** - Inconsistent authentication state handling across the application
5. **Performance Issues** - Profile operations are slow and impact user experience
6. **Network Reliability** - No graceful handling of connection issues or offline scenarios
7. **Security Gaps** - Missing rate limiting and audit logging for profile changes

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Persistent Profile Management

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to update my profile information and have it saved permanently, so that I don't lose my personal details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates their profile information THEN the system SHALL save all changes to the database
2. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL NOT require re-authentication
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page after profile updates THEN their changes SHALL still be visible
4. WHEN a user updates their email address THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness before saving
5. WHEN profile updates fail THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages without losing authentication

### Requirement 2: Authentication State Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to remain active when I update my profile, so that I don't have to keep logging in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN their authentication token SHALL remain valid
2. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN they SHALL NOT be redirected to the login page
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle refresh gracefully
4. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN their session SHALL persist if "remember me" was selected
5. IF authentication fails during profile updates THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback without creating loops

### Requirement 3: Cart Preservation Across Authentication States

**User Story:** As a guest user, I want my cart items to be preserved when I create an account or log in, so that I don't lose my selected products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest user has items in their cart AND logs in THEN their cart items SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN a guest user has items in their cart AND registers THEN their cart items SHALL be merged with their new account
3. WHEN a logged-in user adds items to cart THEN the items SHALL be associated with their account
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN their cart SHALL be preserved in their account for next login
5. WHEN cart merging occurs THEN duplicate items SHALL have quantities combined appropriately

### Requirement 4: Address Management

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to manage multiple addresses (shipping, billing) easily, so that I can have different delivery and payment locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a new address THEN it SHALL be saved to their profile permanently
2. WHEN a user updates an existing address THEN the changes SHALL be saved without affecting other addresses
3. WHEN a user deletes an address THEN it SHALL be removed from their profile
4. WHEN a user has multiple addresses THEN they SHALL be able to set one as default
5. WHEN a user updates addresses THEN their authentication state SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when profile operations succeed or fail, so that I understand what happened and what to do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile updates succeed THEN the system SHALL display a success message
2. WHEN profile updates fail THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic fields
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
5. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL guide users to re-authenticate without losing their work

### Requirement 6: Session and Token Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to work reliably across different parts of the application, so that I have a seamless experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN their session SHALL be established consistently across all API endpoints
2. WHEN authentication tokens are used THEN they SHALL be validated consistently
3. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle renewal gracefully
4. WHEN users switch between guest and authenticated states THEN the transition SHALL be seamless
5. WHEN CSRF tokens are required THEN they SHALL be managed automatically without user intervention

### Requirement 7: Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile data to be consistent across all parts of the application, so that I see the same information everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile data is updated THEN it SHALL be reflected immediately in all UI components
2. WHEN user data is fetched THEN it SHALL always return the most current information
3. WHEN multiple browser tabs are open THEN profile changes SHALL be synchronized via event-driven updates
4. WHEN the application state is refreshed THEN user data SHALL be reloaded correctly
5. WHEN caching is used THEN it SHALL be invalidated appropriately after updates with TTL management

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want profile operations to be fast and responsive, so that I have a smooth experience even during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the operation SHALL complete within 200ms
2. WHEN cart synchronization occurs THEN it SHALL complete within 100ms
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL handle 1000 concurrent profile updates without degradation
4. WHEN profile data is cached THEN it SHALL use optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
5. WHEN database connections are needed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling for efficiency

### Requirement 9: Offline Capability and Progressive Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic functionality to work even when my connection is unstable, so that I don't lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loses network connectivity THEN profile changes SHALL be stored locally and synced when connection returns
2. WHEN JavaScript fails to load THEN basic profile viewing SHALL still function
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry automatically with exponential backoff
4. WHEN offline mode is active THEN the user SHALL see clear indicators of sync status
5. WHEN network returns THEN conflicts SHALL be resolved gracefully with user confirmation

### Requirement 10: Security and Audit

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile changes to be secure and properly tracked, so that my account remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile updates are submitted THEN they SHALL be rate-limited to prevent abuse (max 10 updates per minute)
2. WHEN sensitive profile data is changed THEN it SHALL be logged for audit purposes
3. WHEN input is received THEN it SHALL be sanitized and validated before processing
4. WHEN authentication tokens are used THEN they SHALL be properly validated and refreshed
5. WHEN profile changes occur THEN the user SHALL receive confirmation via their registered email
