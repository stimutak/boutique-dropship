# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive social authentication integration to the holistic dropship store, allowing users to sign in using popular social media platforms including Apple, Google, X (Twitter), Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, and other OAuth providers. This will streamline the user registration and login process, reduce friction for new customers, and provide a modern authentication experience that aligns with user expectations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new customer, I want to sign in with my existing social media accounts, so that I can quickly create an account without filling out lengthy registration forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display social sign-in buttons for Apple, Google, X, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram
2. WHEN a user clicks a social sign-in button THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the respective OAuth provider's authorization page
3. WHEN a user successfully authorizes the application THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with information from the social provider
4. WHEN a user's social account lacks required information THEN the system SHALL prompt them to complete their profile with missing details
5. IF a user's email from social provider already exists in the system THEN the system SHALL link the social account to the existing user account

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning customer, I want to sign in with any of my previously linked social accounts, so that I can access my account quickly without remembering passwords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a returning user clicks a social sign-in button THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to their intended destination
2. WHEN a user has multiple social accounts linked THEN the system SHALL allow sign-in with any of the linked accounts
3. WHEN a user signs in with a social account THEN the system SHALL maintain their session according to the same rules as traditional login
4. IF a social provider returns an error THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message and fallback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to link and unlink social accounts from my profile, so that I can manage my authentication methods and maintain account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile settings THEN the system SHALL display a section for managing connected social accounts
2. WHEN a user clicks to link a new social account THEN the system SHALL initiate the OAuth flow and link the account upon successful authorization
3. WHEN a user clicks to unlink a social account THEN the system SHALL remove the connection after confirming the action
4. IF a user attempts to unlink their only authentication method THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and require them to set a password or keep at least one method
5. WHEN a user links a social account THEN the system SHALL update their profile with any new information from the social provider (with user consent)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure which social providers are available and manage their settings, so that I can control the authentication options and maintain security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the social auth configuration THEN the system SHALL display settings for each supported provider
2. WHEN an administrator enables/disables a provider THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the change on the login page
3. WHEN an administrator updates OAuth credentials THEN the system SHALL validate the credentials and store them securely
4. WHEN the system encounters OAuth errors THEN it SHALL log detailed information for administrator troubleshooting
5. IF a provider's API changes or becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and notify administrators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my social sign-in experience to be secure and respect my privacy, so that I can trust the platform with my personal information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates social sign-in THEN the system SHALL only request necessary permissions from the social provider
2. WHEN the system receives user data from social providers THEN it SHALL store only required information and respect user privacy preferences
3. WHEN a user signs in with a social account THEN the system SHALL use secure token handling and follow OAuth 2.0 best practices
4. WHEN social provider tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle refresh tokens appropriately or prompt for re-authentication
5. IF a security issue is detected with social authentication THEN the system SHALL log the incident and take appropriate protective measures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want social sign-in to work seamlessly on my device, so that I can authenticate using my device's native social app integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mobile user clicks a social sign-in button THEN the system SHALL attempt to use the native app if available, otherwise fall back to web authentication
2. WHEN using native app authentication THEN the system SHALL handle the app-to-web handoff smoothly
3. WHEN a user completes social authentication on mobile THEN the system SHALL redirect them appropriately within the mobile experience
4. IF native app authentication fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to web-based OAuth flow
5. WHEN social sign-in is completed on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain the user session across app/web boundaries as needed
